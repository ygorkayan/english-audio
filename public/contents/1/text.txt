This coffee is good, isn’t it?
Yes, it is! Hello, I’m Sarah.
Hi, Sarah. My name’s Hamid Abboud.
Sorry? Ha ...?
Hamid. H-a-m-i-d. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too, Hamid.
Are you a student here at the language school?
No, I’m not. I’m a teacher – an English teacher.
Oh! That’s great! I’m a student on the design course. It’s my first day.
Oh, great. Welcome. Where are you from, Hamid?
I’m from Egypt.
Oh, lovely! Are you from Cairo?
No, I’m not. I’m from Alexandria.
Well, ... um ... See you soon. Oh! The design studio is in room number seven.
OK.
And the first class is at 10 o’clock. H: Can you repeat that, please?
Yes, of course. It’s at 10 o’clock. H: Oh, OK. Thanks.
See you later!
Bye, Sarah.
