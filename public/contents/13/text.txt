Good morning. Can I help you?
Um ... yes. I want to buy some new bedroom furniture. I’m a student here in the city. I’ve got a new studio flat. It’s really nice, but there isn’t any furniture.
I see. So you want ...?
Um ... first ... I want a bed.
OK. This way, please. We have a lot of different styles and colours. Look.
Oh, yes. I like this one. It’s blue and that’s my favourite colour.
Let me see ... It’s £270.
Oh, dear. That’s very expensive.
How about this one? It’s white. But it isn’t very expensive – just £50.
Oh, yes. That’s good. OK. And ... I also want a desk.
Yes, of course. The desks are here. This brown desk is cheap. It costs £90.
Hmm – yes, it’s a good price, but it’s a bit small. How about that one?
Oh, yes. That’s a nice desk, and it comes with a chair, too. The desk and the chair together cost £100.
Perfect. I’ll take the desk with the chair.
Do you want a bookshelf?
Yes, I do, but I haven’t got money for a bookshelf! 
OK!
Can you bring the things to my new flat?
Yes. No problem. What’s your address?
It’s Flat 4b, 60 West Street. 
OK. So ... that’s £150 altogether, please.
Here’s my card.
Thank you.
Thanks very much. Goodbye. 
Bye.
