Yes, of course. Um ... Let me see. Sam has his breakfast at eight o’clock.
OK. What does he like to eat for breakfast?
He usually has bread and jam. And some milk, of course.
That’s fine.
After breakfast, we usually go for a walk in the park, and Sam plays with his ball.
Where’s his coat?
It’s over there. It’s blue.
It’s cold today. Does he have a hat, too?
Yes, here it is. We usually eat lunch together. I don’t cook a big meal at lunchtime. We have some eggs. Sam likes pasta, too.
Does Sam have juice to drink? M: Oh, no. It’s got a lot of sugar. He
drinks water.
OK. Does he go to bed in the afternoon?
Yes, for an hour.
I understand. And what time do
you come home from work?
At four o’clock. But today is Thursday.
I don’t understand.
Oh, sorry. I finish work early on
Thursdays – at three o’clock. W: Fine. See you at three o’clock. M: Bye, Wendy. Bye, Sam.
S: Bye, Mummy!
