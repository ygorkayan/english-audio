Hello, Anna here.
Hi, Anna. This is Sally.
I’m sorry? Sally?
Yes. Carl’s sister.
Oh, yes! Hi, Sally. How are you?
I’m fine, thanks. Look, I’ve got your hat. Do you want to meet? I can give it to you.
Yes. Thanks.
Um ... Are you free at four o’clock?
Yes, I am.
Do you know Sam’s Café?
Yes.
OK. See you there at four o’clock. Bye.
But, Sally!
Yes?
Have you got short hair ... long hair ...?
Oh, yes, of course! I’ve got short light brown hair and ... a red jacket.
OK. I’ve got long black hair, a blue coat and a black scarf.
