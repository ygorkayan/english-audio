Hello, Anna here.
Hi, Anna. This is Sally.
I’m sorry? Sally?
Yes. Carl’s sister.
Oh, yes! Hi, Sally. How are you?
I’m fine, thanks. Look, I’ve got your hat. Do you want to meet? I can give it to you.
Yes. Thanks.
Um ... Are you free at four o’clock?
Yes, I am.
Do you know Sam’s Café?
Yes.
OK. See you there at four o’clock. Bye.
But, Sally!
Yes?
Have you got short hair ... long hair ...?
Oh, yes, of course! I’ve got short light brown hair and ... a red jacket.
OK. I’ve got long black hair, a blue coat and a black scarf.
Is it a big restaurant?
Yes, it is. And we’ve got a lot of customers, so I’m always busy.
I finish work at three o’clock in the afternoon. Then I go home and
I go to bed for two hours!
And in the evening?
Um ... In the evening, I talk to my friends on the phone, or we go out. We watch a film or go to a café or restaurant to eat.
That’s great! OK. Thanks, Keith! Bye!
Bye!
