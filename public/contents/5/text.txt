Hello, Naomi. Sorry I’m late. 
Hi, Bahati. That’s OK.
How’s everything?
Good. And how are you?
I’m fine, thanks. Here – sit down.
Good afternoon. Coffee?
Yes, a cappuccino, please.
You’ve got a lot of bags, Bahati!
Yes. I’ve got some new things. A lot of new things! Look!
Red headphones? They’re great!
Yes, yes, but look ... a new phone!
Oh! It’s super cool!
It’s perfect!
What else?
A blue sweatshirt. And, glasses – for work.
The glasses are blue, too.
Yes, blue’s my favourite colour. 
Here’s your cappuccino.
Oh, thank you.
