Hello.
Good afternoon. What can
I get you?
Can I have a cappuccino ... no ... a tea, please?
Of course. Small, medium or large?
Medium, please. To take away.
And do you want milk with that?
Yes, please. Can I have a croissant, too?
Sorry, we havenâ€™t got croissants today.
Oh, OK. Just the tea, then.
Here you are.
Thanks. Bye!
